# CodeQuest 2017 Python Solutions

These solutions are written in Python 3. They solve all 18 of the 2017 US problems. You can find the problems in
[the PDF](https://github.com/jarhill0/codequest-2017/blob/master/ProblemPacket2017.pdf). I built these without 
looking at the official Java solutions (are there official Python solutions? If there are, I didn't look at those 
either).

Each problem's materials are in their own numbered directory. For example, `01/` contains, `01.py`, my solution to 
the problem; `Prob01.in.example.txt`, the example input which was provided to contestants during the real 
competition; `Prob01.out.example.txt`, the example output which was provided to contestants during the real 
competition; `Prob01.in.txt`, the secret judging data which was used to determine whether a team's program was 
successful; `Prob01.out.txt`, the expected outcome of that testing; and `my_output.txt`, the cleverly named output of
my own script (copied and pasted into a text file from terminal output).
 
You can verify that my solutions are the same as the expected solutions if you have git installed by running
`python3 verify_solutions.py`.

And, for your benefit as much as mine, here's a list of links directly to my solutions:
